    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <span>
      What is this?
    </span>
    <p>
      This is an NFL Pro Pick'em Pool. You pick which team you think will win each game, and whoever has the most "wins" takes the majority of the pot each week. You pick the games "straight up," with no point spreads.
    </p>    
    <br>

    <span>
      How much does it cost to play?
    </span>
    <p>
      It costs $5 per week to play. Everyone pays upfront for the season. There are 18 weeks in total, so if you want to join for the entire season, it will cost $90 (18 X $5). If you join in Week 2, it will cost $85; in Week 3, $80, and so on.
    </p>
    <br>

    <span>
      How much can I win?
    </span>
    <p>
      It all depends on how many participants are in the pool that given week. The pool payouts will only increase as the season progresses, with more people joining, resulting in more money in the pot to be won. In the final week of the 22-23 Season we finished with 77 entrants and the winner received $370.
    </p>
    <br>

    <span>
      How do I make my picks?
    </span>
    <p>
      We use Yahoo's Pro Pick'em. You can make your picks by logging into Yahoo's website or conveniently using their app on your mobile device. It's very simple: tap the teams you pick to win and hit save. Yahoo and I handle the rest.
    </p>
    <br>

    <span>
      Are winners paid every week?
    </span>
    <p>
      Yes, this is a Weekly Pool. We "reset" every week and start with a clean slate the following week.
    </p>
    <br>

    <span>
      When are winners paid?
    </span>
    <p>
      Yahoo "grades" the pool on Mondays at midnight. Winners promptly receive their winnings every Tuesday. Most people prefer to have it sent to their Venmo, but if you don't use that, I also have PayPal, Cash App, or you can be paid in cash.
    </p>
