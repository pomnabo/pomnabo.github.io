<div class="intro">
    Below are the three starter Pokemon of the Kanto region: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Choosing your starter Pokemon is the most important decision that will guide the trajectory of your journey in the Pokemon world. You can choose your new companion based on its looks, its type advantages and abilities, its evolution chain; the factors are endless! I think the best method is to choose which you like best, regardless of how it performs in battle.

                From the time it is born, a flame burns at the tip of its tail. The flame on its tail indicates Charmander's life force. If it is healthy, the flame burns brightly. Its life would end if the flame were to go out.
