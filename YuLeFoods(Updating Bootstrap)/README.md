pomnabo.github.io/YuLeFoods(Updating Bootstrap)/


This website was built as a concept piece; a working example of my abilities in web development, branding, graphic design, and copywriting. I am building this site alongside my course's practice lectures.
The project started off fairly smoothly, but I soon ran into some roadblocks. Namely I was unknowingly trying to update the lecturerer's code with the most recent version of bootstrap. I was advised, however, that it was an unnecessary, and instead to use the version they were using. So, I will be restarting this project with that advice, and tabling this one for the future. I may come back to it to update the code to the most recent version of boostrap at a later time.
