This is the README file for your website.

Once you have saved and then unzipped your website files, you should be able to upload them to your web host's server. It should be live as soon as its uploaded, but follow your web host's procedures in regards to how you upload html code to your website.

Your images and font files are located within the "assets" folder. If for whatever reason your webhost isn't reading the file locations, you will need to change these to the specific locations as specified in your web host's server.

You will need to re-embed your tickcounter countdown timer because I don't have direct access to it.
