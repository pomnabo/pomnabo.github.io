This is the README file for your website.

Start by unzipping the files to your computer; wherever you wish to save it for your future reference. You can preview your website before uploading it by simply opening the "index.html" document in your preferred browser. If you are pleased with the site, you can upload it to your web host.

(Note: your Javascript counter may not appear in this preview because you are viewing it locally. I tested the site on github, and your javascript counter works fine once it's live.)


Once you have unzipped your website files, you should be able to upload them directly to your web host's server. Your site should be live as soon as its uploaded, but follow your web host's procedures in regards to how you upload html code to your website.

Your images and font files are located within the "assets" folder. If for whatever reason your webhost isn't reading the file locations, you will need to change these to the specific locations within your web host's server directory.
