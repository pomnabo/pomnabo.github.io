This is my first forray into learning Javascript.

The assignment is to create a "guess the number" game.

The interface is quite bland, so I may edit and play around with this in the future to make it more appealing.



11/20/2023: Project Started
Notes: none/tutorial project. Self paced with holiday interruption.


11/29/2023: Project Complete
Notes:
I have edited the text to fit my personality better and changed some of the styling to make it easier on the eyes.

The game is fully functional and works as intended.

I am confused because there is a single hard line that appears after the first play through of the game. It disappears upon page refresh, but will remain following every script reset.
