This website is for practice writing html, css, and javascript.

Bootstrap version from 2005 (v3?)

All images were pulled from Google image searches, and I do not own copyright to them; nor am I claiming copyright.

This website is strictly for practice, and therefore ineligible for commercial use.

Note: The restaurant "YuLe Street Foods" is not a real place (as far as I'm aware). It is merely a concept to guide my practice.

A near identical project is also featured in this github. I originally started on that project with the intention of updating the code to the most recent version of boostrap, however, this was a sorely cumbersome effort; one that, as of writing this, I am not yet knowledgable enough to undertake. So I've set the project aside at the advice of a more experienced developer, to focus on completing my course with the version of bootstrap thats used in the lectures.



Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns! Thanks!
