This website is for practice writing html, css, and javascript.

Bootstrap version from 2015 (v3?)

All images were pulled from Google image searches, and I do not own copyright to them; nor am I claiming copyright.

Update: July 7, 2023
The overall function and foundation of this website project has been completed, however, I still need to add some finer details, including:
-copy for menu item descriptions
-copy for About Us page
-copy for Specials page
-some sort of functioning calendar for the Calendar page
-copy for the Calendar page
-copy for the Awards page
-copy for Testamonials on the Awards page

I will add these details at a later time. For now, this project is considered complete for the purpose of the course I was working on it for.

Note: The restaurant "YuLe Street Foods" is not a real place (as far as I'm aware). It is merely a concept to guide my practice.

A near identical project is also featured in this github. I originally started on that project with the intention of updating the code to the most recent version of boostrap, however, this was a sorely cumbersome effort; one that, as of writing this, I am not yet knowledgable enough to undertake. So I've set that project aside at the advice of a more experienced developer, to focus on completing the website with the version of bootstrap thats used in the lectures.


Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns! Thanks!
