PROJECT: Palindrome Checker

Overview:

This is 5 of 10 small javascript project tutorials featured in Vijay Kumar's Udemy course.

I love palindromes :U
So I enjoyed this project because now I have a fun app to play with! xD

------------------------------
Coding Challenges:

The javascript featured in this project is much farther than what I've read up on, and the concepts were a bit confusing on their own. Since this was my 2nd project in a single day, I plan to focus my practice tomorrow on just reading.

Otherwise, I am completely clueless with the CSS animations used as well. I'll be reading up on the things used here tomorrow.



------------------------------
Other Notes:

I noticed after I had finished writing most of the CSS that I had applied my custom font to every selector; that instead, I could have just applied it once to the body. I consider it good practice, but I went in and removed the excess to keep things clean and tidy! I did have to add it back to the button selector though, and I'm not sure why.

------------------------------
Note To Self:

check about "g flags"
check about what "str" is when designated inside a function's parameters "()"
what does "textContent" do?
what is the "/[]/" used for?
review what exactly the operator === does
check about "classList"
check about ".add"
check about @keyframes and "fadeIn" (was that just a name given to that selector?)
check about css animations
