PROJECT: Counter Application

Overview:

This is 4 of 10 small javascript project tutorials featured in Vijay Kumar's Udemy course. This tutorial guides the viewer in writing a simple web browser application of a manual number counter.

Coding Challenges:

Was proud of myself that I was able to construct about 80%-90% of the html and css just by looking at the demo.

As always, I wanted to style it to my own preferences, so I played around with the colors and size of the application div boxes. I was struggling a bit with the width because I wanted it to be responsive as the demo showed, but I didn't like how wide it was getting with full screen on the desktop. It took a bit of adjusting, but I resolved to set it to a fixed width which I felt was appropriate.

Otherwise, this was a very straightforward project. I felt I understood the javascript well (still not learned enough to produce the code myself though).

I'm hoping perhaps I can call upon this project again as reference to use in some future projects.
