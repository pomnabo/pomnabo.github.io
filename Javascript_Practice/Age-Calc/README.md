PROJECT: Age Calculator Application

Overview:

This is 10 of 10 (Last one of this set!) small javascript project tutorials featured in Vijay Kumar's Udemy course. In this tutorial, the viewer is guided through writing comprehensive age calculator.

Overall, these exercises were great practice. I don't think I'm quite ready yet to produce my own javascript code, but alas, in due time.

Coding Challenges:

I decided to change the input type of the text box from "text" to "date." I felt this was more intuitive, and also supplies a nice calendar gui for easier user entry. As the tutorial went on, I had to sort of constantly adjust what I was doing based on what he was doing, to account for the different input type.

Other than that, I didn't understand much (if any) of the validation code; so I've added it to my list of things to review.

Other Notes:

I realize that the instructor chose to keep the input type as text (rather than date) likely because he wanted to demonstrate the use of validators in javascript. While I can appreciate that, I also want to honor my own knowledge in design principles, and maintain my initial instinct to designate the type as "date." Still, I went ahead and wrote out the code for the validation to make sure I get that practice too. In the end, I had to comment out the validater code, because I wasn't sure how to adjust it to account for my use of a date input.

I also liked challenging myself to adapt my code alongside the tutorial.

While declaring the many variables in this tutorial, I thought it would be fun to add another variable (or even a few) to show the number of
