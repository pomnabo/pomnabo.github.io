PROJECT: Guess The Number Game

This is my first forray into learning Javascript. I was having trouble with the Javascript section of my Coursera course, so I looked to alternatives to learn. I tried The Odin Project, but there was too much introductory material before their Javascript information, so I went to MDN web docs section on Javascript for a more isolated approach.

I like the way MDN introduces this language, so I may continue their learning guide for the time being; or I may jump between these three. My goal is to complete the Coursera course before moving on to other courses.

The assignment is to create a "guess the number" game.

The interface is quite bland, so I may edit and play around with this in the future to make it more appealing.



11/20/2023: Project Started
Notes: none/tutorial project. Self paced with holiday interruption.


11/29/2023: Project Complete
Notes:
I have edited the text to fit my personality better and changed some of the styling to make it easier on the eyes.

The game is fully functional and works as intended.

I am confused because there is a single hard line that appears after the first play through of the game. It disappears upon page refresh, but will remain following every script reset.
