PROJECT: Loan Calculator
Overview:

This is 3 of 10 small javascript project tutorials featured in Vijay Kumar's Udemy course.

It seems this instructor likes to make various calculators. I will still continue their series of exercises, but I am a bit concerned this won't provide enough variation. Even still, the repetition will be helpful!

Coding Challenges:

Not really any challenges this time. I'm looking up operators as I go, so that I know what they do, and when they're used. Still, I'm unsure that I'd be able to remember yet when exactly they're required and when they aren't. In due time.

With each of his tutorials, Vijay gives a demonstration of what the finished project should look like and how it functions. After 2 of these projects, I can already see a pattern where everything takes place inside a neat little widget (container div), so decided that with this project, and going forward (at least with the html and css) I would try to build as much of it on my own just based on the appearance alone.

For the layout design, I wanted to make the title header flow better. After playing with the h2 box, I felt it would look better to have it flush with the border of the rest of the container div; for that, I just moved it outside of the calculator div where it was placed during the tutorial.

Upon completing the tutorial, I was concerned because the page wasn't working. I reviewed my code and realized simple mistakes:
- incorrect cameling
- incorrect variable naming

Fixing both was easy! Since I had tried to build some of the code myself prior to the tutorial, I realized my variable names were different than the tutorial's. While following the tutorial, I forgot to use the names I originally wrote, and instead wrote the ones in the tutorial; so the functions weren't working of course!
