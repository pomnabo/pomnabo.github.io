PROJECT: Love Compatability Calculator

Overview:

This is 1 of 10 small javascript project tutorials featured in Vijay Kumar's Udemy course.

As always, my end result will look different than what the projects specify. I do this for two reasons. First, I want ensure I understand what I'm doing, so I will alter and tinker with the code to try new things to see what else I can do with it. And second, I like to customize things! It's fun to make it your own, and I want to apply my design background to my work.

If I have any goals in learning to program, one would be specifically that; to marry my education in linguistics and design together. Plus, I've been told that if I can be both designer AND builder that my work would be more sought after! (Should be blessed with more web development work that is!)

Lastly, I decided to change this up a bit and make it my own (as I do with almost any project I take on); so instead of a simple "love calculator," I've changed the verbiage to "starsign." I may change the input types and calculation later to better reflect what's commonly accepted for starsign compatability.

Overall, fun little project to get myself back into learning!

Challenges:

I didn't really encounter any challenges thankfully, as this was pretty straightforward. I am familiar enough with HTML and CSS that I was able to adjust those to my liking as I went, rather than doing so after writing what was provided.

This was also a great opportunity to learn the difference between stating the <script> tag in the header as opposed to the body; and specifically that using "deter" in the tag will function similiarly as if it were placed at the end of the body. Some sources I read from claimed that this allowed the script to download simultaneously with the html, so it would be available sooner once the html was done loading.

The only other challenge I had was minor. I kept seeing "NaN" in the results area of the div, and when I looked back at the javascript file, I saw that I forgot to add "()" in the lovePercentage variable.

Update Jun 19, 2024:
I wanted to spice this up before I moved on (I know! I know...I should just move on xD), so I am currently working on customizing the appearance of the alert box. Still struggling to figure out how to make it work, but I've made a little progress. Still struggling to figure out how to do it, but for now, I've commented out the bits I tried and will revisit this later perhaps.

I also wanted to make the background less bland, and found a cool tutorial on One DIV for making a starry background with CSS. It was a big clump of points and I hope that it doesn't slow the page too much, but it worked smoothly!
