PROJECT: Tip Calculator Application

Overview:

This is 7 of 10 small javascript project tutorials featured in Vijay Kumar's Udemy course. In this tutorial, the viewer is guided through writing a simple tip calculator.

Coding Challenges:


I'm not sure if this is intentional, but the instructor used many different html elements and css selectors than in previous projects. This confuses me because I can't tell if he's doing it intentionally to introduce students to the variety available, or if he's just haphazardly using them.

I was able to write about 90% of the html and css myself before watching his demonstrations for each, but the use of alternative designations threw me off. It was also confusing because certain css selectors were overwriting when I was following his demonstration; so I changed them a bit to target the selectors I was intending to style.

The last challenge is something that I am unable to discern; specifically the "if mealType" condition. It's not adding the 5 to the total values.

Other Notes:

I thought it would be interesting to add a select option for "No service/self service," and I wanted to provide a statement for the tip, rather than just make it 0. I commented out the 2 ways I attempted this, but neither seemed to work. Perhaps I'll revisit this project when I am understand how to do this better, so I can change it. For now at least, I did leave it as a 0 amount!
