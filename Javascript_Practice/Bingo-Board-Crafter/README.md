PROJECT: Bingo Card Crafter

Overview:

My friends and I were preparing to watch the new season of ABC's 9-1-1, and wanted to play bingo throughout the season. To make crafting the cards easier, I tasked myself with this project to see what I could come up with based on what I've learned.

------------------------------
LOGIC:

My initial idea is to setup a form where users can input their bingo prompts, and then once submitted, will produce the bingo board with their prompts randomly placed in a grid of divs. For smoother UI/UX, I felt it would be best to have users submit all of their prompts into a single text box, rather than individual submission lines. I figured I should put all of the prompts into a single, disugstingly long array, that way I could extract each of them based on their array sequence number.

As I begain this project, I was not yet sure if there's an easier way to attempt this, but I figured it would be better to apply what I already know before I seek alternative solutions.


------------------------------
Coding Challenges:

I think the largest challenge I'm going to have is getting the submission of info 

For smoother UI/UX, I felt nesting the instructions inside a toggle-able drop down menu would be ideal; this way, users who are familiar with how to use the crafter can keep it minimized to save screen space, *especially* if they're doing it from their phones. The first thing recommended through google searching was the "details" element. I'd never used it before, so it was fun to play around with. When first applied, the arrow appeared above it's summary, but I wanted it aligned; google searching again helped haha, and applying "display: flex;" did the trick.
