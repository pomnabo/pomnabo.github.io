Almost immediately, I realized the gender dicotomy was something I wanted to customize for my own project; to be more inclusive of other genders. After a quick google search, and some reading, I concluded that for this project, it would be difficult to accurately account for gender variation overall, and most especially the trans community. It's also highly debated whether or not BMI is a useful calculation when it comes to health and wellness, based on more recent research over the last decade. I concluded to simply add a short disclaimer about the gender dropdown selection, to advise users to select the gender that is closest to their dominant hormones.

I know that this doesn't quite suffice, but I am also not an expert when it comes to measuring an individual's health based on these factors, and don't have the resources to produce a better selection for such a meager project. Ultimately, this project is not meant to be this extensive, and I do not want to misinform anyone either.

If you have information that you feel would provide a more in-depth explanation of this measurement and how it intersects with non-binary gender indentity and trans people, I would love to hear from you! Please send me an email with any pertinent information to contact@pomnabo.com.
