PROJECT: BMI Calculator
Overview:

This is 2 of 10 small javascript project tutorials featured in Vijay Kumar's Udemy course.

------------------------------
Coding Challenges:

I had no challenges really with this exercise. The only hang up was when I tried adding two fonts; I've never done that before, and didn't recall learning that each font would need its own @font-face line in the stylesheet. Once added, the page ran as intended.

Overall, I feel I understood what the tutorial was doing as we went along, but I am still not confident that I could think to do any of this on my own yet. Hopefully after another 60 of these projects I'll have a better grasp of things!

------------------------------
Other Challenges:

Almost immediately, I realized the gender dicotomy was something I wanted to customize for my own project; to be more inclusive of other genders. After a quick google search, and some reading, I concluded that for this project, it would be difficult to accurately account for gender variation overall, and most especially the trans community. It's also highly debated whether or not BMI is a useful calculation when it comes to health and wellness, based on more recent research over the last decade. I concluded to simply add a short disclaimer about the gender dropdown selection, to advise users to select the gender that is closest to their dominant hormones.

I know that this doesn't quite suffice, but I am also not an expert when it comes to measuring an individual's health based on these factors, and don't have the resources to produce a better selection for such a meager project. Ultimately, this project is not meant to be this extensive, and I do not want to misinform anyone either.

If you have information that you feel would provide a more in-depth explanation of this measurement and how it intersects with non-binary gender indentity and trans people, I would love to hear from you! Please send me an email with any pertinent information to contact@pomnabo.com.



Not as much of a challenge, but upon checking the completion of the javascript, I found the calculation to be inaccurate; so I changed the equation to account for this.

Additional Notes:

To enable a more accessible internet experience, I decided to start running my projects through a colorblindness filter site to ensure the color schemes I choose are accessible to everyone. If I find the time, and feel inclinded, I would like to update previous projects with more accessible color schemes.
