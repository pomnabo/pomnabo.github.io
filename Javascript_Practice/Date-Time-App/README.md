PROJECT: Date & Time Widget Application

Overview:

This is 8 of 10 small javascript project tutorials featured in Vijay Kumar's Udemy course. In this tutorial, the viewer is guided through writing a widget that displays the date and time.

------------------------------
Coding Challenges:

Not so much a coding challenge as it is a visibility issue; the video window for the tutorials makes the code small, which is hard to read. I'll be maximizing the screen from now on just in case!

Basically, at the end of the tutorial, my widget wasn't updating the time. The issue was simply that instead of using "()" when updating the time, I used "[]."

Otherwise, this tutorial again featured use of some strange html tag use, and style conventions. I would say it definitely seems intentional; that the instructor is introducing the variation, but I think it just makes things a little confusing personally. I would prefer to learn what is standard in the industry, rather than accidentally learn any bad habits (like using <p> tags to create a line break when <br> should be used instead). Still...I suppose this may be something that I would encounter in a real world setting; variation of the conventions. So perhaps it's beneficial to learn different ways, so that I can adapt to each project/company's own coding conventions.


------------------------------
Other Notes:

I didn't like how the colors were different for each chunk of the time values; especially because the seconds color was too close in saturation and shade to the background. So naturally I styled it to my liking. I also didn't like how the colons between each time chunk value were right on their closest value; so instead, I just added the colons as a fixed part of the HTML and put the spans between them.

I wanted to try adding the year value as well, but the formulas this tutorial uses in the javascript are a little above my learned level, so I wouldn't even know where to start adding that. Perhaps I will revisit this project later to udpate that!
